<center><h1>SPACE WEEK 2019: AFTER CHANDRAYAAN 2, ISRO'S UPCOMING INTERPLANETARY MISSIONS TO MARS, VENUS, THE SUN</h1></center>

<p>The Vikram lander and Pragyan rover, part of India's first attempt to land on the moon with the Chandrayaan 2 mission, appear to be 
incommunicado on the moon's surface after a failed 7 September crash landing. But the Indian Space Research Organisation's (ISRO's) 
has a packed couple of years ahead, with a string of interesting (and interplanetary) projects on its to-do list in the near-future.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.firstpost.com/tech/chandrayaan-2">Chandrayaan 2 mission</a> (and the Gaganyaan manned mission planned for 2022 
are two of the better-known, bigger-budget missions, 
but far from the only ones for which work is underway. The agency is also working on a total of seven interplanetary missions in the 
coming decade. Among the destinations are Mars, the Moon, Venus, the Sun's corona and interplanetary space to study space.</p>

<td>The<a href="https://www.firstpost.com/tech/science/all-about-the-aditya-l1-isros-upcoming-satellite-to-unveil-secrets-of-the-sun-4974891.html">Aditya-L1 mission</a> 
is ISRO's first planned probe to study the Sun's corona and its atmosphere. The corona is the outer layer of the Sun,
 which extends thousands of km above the visible disc around it.<br>
Interestingly, it has temperatures over a million degree Kelvin — far higher than the surface of the Sun (6000 degrees Kelvin). How the corona 
gets heated to such high temperatures is still an unanswered question in solar physics, and something NASA's Parker probe is currently exploring.<br>
ISRO's Aditya L-1 will also soon follow suit and study this astrophysical mystery.  The probe is <a href="https://www.firstpost.com/tech/science/all-about-the-aditya-l1
-isros-upcoming-satellite-to-unveil-secrets-of-the-sun-4974891.html">expected to launch in April 2020 on a PSLV </a>rocket 
from Sriharikota, according to ISRO's website.</td>
<td>In his 2018 Independence Day address, the Prime Minister<a href="https://www.firstpost.com/tech/science/independence-day-2018-narendra-modi-announces-a-manned-mission
-to-space-by-2022-4968781.html"> Narendra Modi announced that India will attempt</a>to send astronauts to space on a spacecraft 
called the 'Gaganyaan' by 2022.<br>
The mission will make India only the fourth nation in the world to accomplish the feat if successful, he added. At Rs 10,000 crore, Gaganyaan is slated 
to be India's biggest, boldest space mission so far.<br>
The Gaganyaan’s crew module to house astronauts, its life support systems to keep them alive in space, and the spacecraft's environmental control systems
have<a href="https://www.firstpost.com/tech/science/isros-crew-capsule-and-space-suits-star-attractions-at-bengaluru-space-expo-5141301.html"> already been developed</a>,

The mission is "highest priority" for ISRO in 2019, the space agency <a href="https://www.firstpost.com/tech/science/isro-opens-doors-to-indias-first-human-spaceflight-
centre-in-bangalore-6006801.html">announced</a>, with plans to have the first unmanned tests for the mission in December 
2020 and second in July 2021. If these tests are successful, the manned mission will happen as planned in December 2021.</td>

<td>India's second mission to Mars, the Mars Orbiter-2, is another planned mission by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) between 2022 and 2023. 
The Mangalyaan-2 orbiter will use aerobraking to lower its initial apoapsis and enter into an orbit more suitable for observations. This mission, much like 
the Mangalyaan-1 mission has been planned as an orbiter-alone mission, and won't feature a lander or rover.<br>
India's ISRO and French CNES space agencies were<a href="https://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/isro-and-french-space-agency-to-work-together-on-autonomous-navigation-of
-rovers-on-the-moon-and-mars-4435255.html"> intended as partners building the MOM-2 module</a> by 2020, but by April 2018, France was not yet involved in the mission.<br>
In a sign of encouragement, the Indian government-funded the MOM-2 mission in its 2017 budget proposal, leaving ISRO mulling over whether the best path is a MOM mission
with an orbiter, lander and rover will be feasible or an orbiter alone with instruments more sophisticated than those on MOM-1 would be the way to go.</td>
<td>While the second mission in the Chandrayaan (India's lunar exploration) programme is still currently underway, K Sivan announced in January this year that the 
third mission in the series will also be carried out in the coming decade. The Chandrayaan program was always intended as a multi-mission space programme.<br>
"The Moon is a good candidate as a staging point for carrying out our deep space human spaceflight missions, and Chandrayaan-2 will assess the suitability of the Moon 
for such activities," Chairman K Sivan said in<a href=""https://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/114/11/2228.pdf> an interview to </a>Current Science.<br>
ISRO will also soon initiate a space robotics programme to look at the possibility of an Indian robot on the Moon,<a href="https://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/114/11/2228.pdf"> 
he added</a>.With the first mission in the program featuring 
an Orbiter and the second featuring a soft lander and rover, it sure is interesting to consider what India's third lunar mission might bring to the table. Could Chandrayaan-3
 be the mission to put an Indian robot on the Moon?</td>

<td>Our neighbouring planet Venus is often described as Earth's 'twin sister' due to similarities in their sizes, densities, composition and gravity. Some theories suggest 
both planets share a common origin, forming at the same time from the same condensing swirl of gas and dust all those 4.5 billion years ago. Being 30 percent closer to the 
Sun than the Earth, Venus has a much higher exposure to solar radiation, effects of solar flares and other solar phenomena, which makes it an object of interest
for ISRO to study.<br>
ISRO<a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/announcement-of-opportunity-ao-space-based-experiments-to-study-venus"> intends to send an orbiter mission</a> to study the atmosphere 
of Venus, which is made up primarily of carbon dioxide. The Shukrayaan mission will study the dense, 
hot atmosphere of Venus and the planet's surface using a probe.<br>
The satellite configuration and payloads on Shukrayaan-1 are yet to be finalised. But the science objectives that will feed the design of the spacecraft are  
The "super-rotation" of the Venusian atmosphere and how it interacts with solar radiation and solar wind are also among the mission's science objectives, 
according to an <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/announcement-of-opportunity-ao-space-based-experiments-to-study-venus">ISRO release</a>.</td>
<td>The EXPOSat mission appears to be a follow-up to the AstroSAT mission, ISRO's multi-wavelength X-ray astronomy observatory studying X-ray sources in the universe. 
Considering the great success of AstroSAT, the EXPOSat mission will further explore X-rays in the universe — specifically, the polarisation of bright X-ray sources 
in our universe.<br>
These objects could be neutron stars, supernova remnants, pulsars and regions around black holes that could give scientists information about the electromagnetic nature 
of space radiation. Understanding space radiation better could be used to protect spacecraft and astronauts in the future, but also pave the way for space technology to 
better understand happenings in the universe.<br>
These, K Sivan <a href="https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-isro-planning-7-interplanetary-missions-venus-on-the-to-do-list-2750331">said at the briefing</a>, are only 
some of the planned interplanetary missions ISRO has in mind for the decade to come.</td>
